# IV Partners — Homepage Prototype

This repo is a lightweight, dependency-free prototype for a private equity fund homepage.

## Run locally

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or
- Serve it (recommended for consistent behavior):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 5173
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173`.

## Fonts

When you’re ready, drop your `.ttf` files into `fonts/` and update the `@font-face` blocks in `styles.css`.
